## Getting started

#### Step 1: Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/idurar/idurar-erp-crm.git
```

```bash
cd idurar-erp-crm
```

#### Step 2: Install Frontend Dependencies

```bash
cd frontend
```

```bash
npm install
```

#### Step 3: Run the Frontend Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

This starts the UI-only app on `http://localhost:3000`.

The React UI can still run with local dummy data. See [Agent/AgentremovingBackend.md](Agent/AgentremovingBackend.md) for how the old Node API was removed, and [Agent/AgentPlanBackend.md](Agent/AgentPlanBackend.md) for the PHP/SQL backend plan.

:exclamation: :warning:` If you encounter an OpenSSL error while running the frontend server, follow these additional steps:`

Reason behind error: This is caused by the node.js V17 compatible issues with OpenSSL, see [this](https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/40547) and [this](https://github.com/webpack/webpack/issues/14532) issue on GitHub.

Try one of these and error will be solved

- > upgrade to Node.js v20.

- > Enable legacy OpenSSL provider

Here is how you can enable legacy OpenSSL provider

- On Unix-like (Linux, macOS, Git bash, etc.)

```bash
export NODE_OPTIONS=--openssl-legacy-provider
```

- On Windows command prompt:

```bash
set NODE_OPTIONS=--openssl-legacy-provider
```

- On PowerShell:

```bash
$env:NODE_OPTIONS = "--openssl-legacy-provider"
```

Here is [reference](https://github.com/webpack/webpack/issues/14532#issuecomment-947012063) about enabling legacy OpenSSL provider

After trying above solutions, run below command

```bash
npm run dev
```
